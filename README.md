# Online Keyboard

Type in Korean without installing a Korean keyboard!

## How it works
1. Parse into Korean characters using Dubeolsik keyboard layout.  
   dkssud -> ㅇㅏㄴㄴㅕㅇ
2. Combine initial, medial and final jamo.  
   ㅇㅏㄴㄴㅕㅇ -> 안녕

## More features to come...
* ~~Auto-highlight keys on hover~~: *Done*
* Click keys to type: *In progress*
* Support romanization to Korean parsing
